## Introduction 

Welcome to my C++ blog in where i am detailing a Digital rain Project using Modern C++.
In this Blog you will see my take on digital rain in where a variety of C++ capabilities are implented within.
In this Blog we will go through the inner working of my Project, referencing the Design of the project, 
the Problem Solving needed throughout the project when issues were seen, aswell as the Algorithms used in the Project, and finally to wrap it up
i will give a reflective section detailing my insights into Modern C++ and my experiences throughout the development of the Digital Rain Project.



## Project Overview 
  For this Project I am using Modern C++ to write my code in the Visual Studio 2022 IDE.
  Predominately my code was written in C++11.

  My project idea was to create binary display of 0s and 1s that would fall with a random colour scheme given to the 0s and 1s.
  I thought this was a simple concept snd in attempts to make it more challenging i decided to mold my code as to see shapes of 4 types,
  and these shaps would be populated by the 1s and 0s and would be show one after the other on the console replicating a falling motion.
