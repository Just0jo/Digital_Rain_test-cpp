## Issues Seen During Project 
 1. Overlapping Shapes

## OverLapping Shapes
An issue seen in my code was that when printing out the shapes unto the terminal,
the shapes would come out all muddled and jumbled together.

How it appeared.


-----FIX----

To fix this issue what i did was add code to clear clean everytime a shape has been printed as to allow the next shape print on a clear screen and also to keep the width and length at a resonable dimensions.

Give reasonable Dimensions.

## Decimal Numbers
Another issue that was seen was instead of printing whole numbers between 0 and 1 it print decimals between 0 and 1.

How it appeared.

-----FIX----

To fix this issue i had to change the function defintions and change the type input the termainal takes in,
so instead of it being Intergers i had it as Doubles which allowed for decimal numbers.
