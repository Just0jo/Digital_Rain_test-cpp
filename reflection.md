## Programming Concepts
My DigitalRain project demonstrates an approach to creating visual effects in a console application.             
Its architecture showcases several important programming concepts:

Object-Oriented Design: The code applies functionality within the DigitalRain class.

Function Flexibility: Each shape-drawing function is independent, allowing for easy additions or modifications without affecting other parts of the codebase.

Modern C++ Usage: The code employs C++11 features like uniform initialization, range-based loops, and the modern random number generation facilities (<random> library).

Mathematic Algorithms: The use of mathematical formulas and Algorithms are used throughout to create my desird shapes.

Non-Blocking Input: The keyboard input handling allows for responsive user interaction without halting the Digital Rain process.

## Aesthetic Considerations
 
The project creates an engaging visual experience through several design choices:

Color Variation: Random color assignment creates visual interest and prevents dull look.

Shapes Diversty: The four different shapes provide variety to keep the viewer engaged.

Binary Aesthetic: The use of 0s and 1s creates a classic "digital rain" effect reminiscent of The Matrix, which is both nostalgic and visually appealing.

## What i Learned 
In all the creation of the Digital Rain Project was both enlightening and engaging, i was able to see how we can apply mathematical formulae into code to create visually appealing shapes.
I was also able to see how such minor mistakes or oversights can be costly in the appearance of ur final product for instance in my case the use of 'Doubles' instead of 'Integers'.
The research and investigation stage was also very effective in not only helping in the code development but teaching me effective ways to code in C++ whilst avoiding reverting to a comfortable C syle.
